### Bitcoin Hashrate Analysis
This analysis explores the current hashrate values sourced from blockchain.com and use rolling day averages as a mean of technical analysis. There is a significant drop in hashrate in the middle of 2021 due to China Ban and it ever since has increased to all time highs.

### Bitcoin Hashprice
Hashprice is the market value per unit of hashing power. The unit is measured by dollar per terahash per second per day. The higher the hashing power, the cheaper the value of miner's hashing power becomes and vice versa when the hashrate drops, the value per unit of hashing power increases. Therefore hashprice has a negative correlation to hashrate. Hashrate is affected by changes in mining difficulty and bitcoin's price. As of February 2/25, the hashprice is approximately $0.20.

### Bitcoin Miners Economics
This analysis looks at the miners and their specifications in order to evaluate their value. The graphs contain a scatterplot comparing the power efficiencies and hashrate power. The more efficient the miner is, the less power it needs to produce a hash. Therefore, if the plot is viewed in quadrants, the lower right quadrant would be a favorable choice for picking the miner. In addition, Denverâ€™s Derivative(DD) is introduced in a sample of popular miners in the market. The DD accounts for current hashprices without a direct evaluation from bitcoin price. Various scores allow for evaluation for the ASIC price, how long the ASIC would run for, and the level to borrow to buy all hardware.
